# Pillars Academy Website

This is a static website generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Most pages are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Updating the menus

Update the [menu data file](https://github.com/pillarsacademy/pillarsacademy.github.io/blob/master/_data/menu.yml) to modify the list of menu elements. Each element starts with a hypen as shown in the example below. You can edit the following things for a menu:

- path
- title to show in the menu
- banner image
- href link if you want the banner to be clickable

```yaml
- path: about
  title: "About"
  banner: /templates/alridah/images/header/missionvision.jpg
  href:
```

Each menu also has a sub-menu that appears below the banner. Just like the menu, these have a path and a title. The menu path must match the folder that the file is in and the item path must match the name of the file (minus the `.md` suffix).

## Uploading images

Currently the Github web interface does not allow you to directly upload images, so you'll need to use the Github client for Mac or Windows. However, you can also use the following workaround for now:

1. Click [here](https://github.com/pillarsacademy/pillarsacademy.github.io/issues/1) and drag your image to the `Leave a comment box`.
2. Copy the markdown that was generated, you'll paste that wherever you want to put the image later. If you only want the URL (for the carousel for example) just copy everything inside of the parenthesis.
3. Click the `Comment` button to save the comment (this might not be required, the image should still remain even if you don't save the comment).

## Updating the embedded newsletter

1. Click on the "Past Issues" link in the Newsletter section.
2. Right-click on the latest issue, and save the shortcut URL.
3. Paste that copied shortcut in `/news/newsletter.html` to overwrite the existing one.
