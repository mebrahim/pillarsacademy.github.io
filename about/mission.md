# Our Mission

Pillars Academy is a private Islamic school established by the Orange County Islamic Foundation (OCIF) in the year 2000. Our focus is to provide a holistic approach to education by addressing the spiritual, academic, social, and emotional needs of a child. Our curriculum stresses excellence in core academic subjects and in Islamic studies taught by caring and qualified teachers. Our students belong to a community of faith, including parents and teachers, which strengthen their identity as Muslims. Students are encouraged to be leaders and to strive to improve themselves, their families, their communities, and their environment.

# Our Vision

Pillars Academy graduates are well rounded individuals who excel in core academics and posses skills to read, write, and speak not just English, but also Arabic as it is the language of the Quran. They emerge as God conscious leaders who seek the pleasure of their Creator through service to humanity.

# Our Philosophy

Our school's philosophy is based on the "Developmental Approach:" teaching skills appropriate for the developmental age of each individual child. Learning such skills is best accomplished in an active learning program,which promotes experimentation, exploration, and discovery. We believe academic excellence is achieved by developing critical thinking skills that are reinforced through positive peer and adult interaction. Emphasis on Islamic values will help children develop a high self-esteem, a positive self-image, and an Islamic identity.
