# Why Parents Love Pillars Academy

My kids have been attending Pillars Academy (formerly Al-Ridah Academy) since pre-school; my older son is now in 5th grade and my younger in 2nd.

My husband and I decided an Islamic school over public school mainly to surround our kids with Islamic values at home and outside of our home. As Muslim parents we are obligated to introduce and teach Islam to our children.  An Islamic school is the best resource to help parents achieve this obligation.

We couldn't be happier with our decision. Pillars Academy is our BIGGEST peace of mind. We love the caring and loving environment. Our experience with the teachers in all these years has been great. The teachers challenge our kids to strive beyond their grade level; the encouragement they have received has helped them build very strong character. SAT 10 results at the end of every year make it evident that academically Pillars Academy has surpassed public schools. Our kids' passion and interest for Islam is evident in the Islamic Studies and the Quran classes that not only taught them Islam, but also made them fall in love with it. What more could we ask for?

My husband and I are extremely thankful to Allah (SWT) for two beautiful kids and even more thankful for providing the opportunity and resources to raise them as good Muslims.

May Allah (SWT) make Pillars Academy the most successful Islamic school in Orange County and inshaAllah one day we will say, "Our kids graduated high school from Pillars Academy.”

When I joined Pillars Academy, I felt at home from the first day. The administration and staff are incredibly welcoming and friendly. The level of professionalism and the high quality of education reassure me that Pillars Academy is the opening road to future success in every aspect of my children’s lives.

Our 6 year-old has attended Pillars Academy for the past 3 years. She refuses to go to any other school.  When she first began preschool, her teacher exhibited genuine love and affection towards her; through this she felt secure in her environment and was less inclined to cling on to us at drop-off time. After a few years of being surrounded by strong Islamic values and positive role models, our daughter has discovered pride in her Muslim identity. She has equally gained both academic and emotional intelligence (the latter is very hard to come by in the world we live in today!). We both strongly agree that Pillars Academy is the best investment we would ever make towards our daughter’s future. We look forward to the coming years, insh’Allah.

For the past 3 years, I have had two children at Pillars Academy.  It is a wonderful school. The teachers and administration really have the best interest of the kids at heart, and are able to provide a true sense of community.  The administration is very approachable and open to suggestions from the parents and the community. Parent involvement also continues to grow and make the school stronger.  The small classroom sizes are a blessing and allow for individual attention for teachers to cater to my children. My children love to go to school!
