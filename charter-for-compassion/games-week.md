Somewhere between Homecoming and Halloween there’s a new event transforming campuses across the country. [The School League Compassion Games](https://charterforcompassion.org/node/7904), held October 15th to October 25th, are a time for students, faculty and staff to showcase their existing compassionate projects and start new ones.

Pillars Academy is one of [countless schools and colleges](http://compassiongames.org/compassion-games-2/), public and private, who are joining the passion for compassion by letting their hearts and deeds make a difference at school, at home and in their communities. What makes the games unique is that campuses are all sharing the magic and healing power of kind words, service and generosity during the same ten day period.

COME show YOUR Compassion with your Support, Participation, or Attendance at any of the Pillars Academy Students'
"Compassion Games" October 15th-25th!

Every school shares in the collective difference they’ve made as a campus and as a league.By participating, players are called upon to perform acts of service and kindness in our neighborhoods, on the job, with service-providing agencies, and wherever their daily journey takes them. The acts of service are organized projects or simple acts of kindness to aid a neighbor in need. Although during the annual "co-opetition" we measure and tally the numbers of volunteers, hours of community service, money raised for causes, and the number of people served, no one can lose the Compassion Games.
