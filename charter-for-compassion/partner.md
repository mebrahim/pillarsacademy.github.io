<center>**Pillars Academy – School of Compassion Proclamation**</center>

<center>**Whereas**, the principle of compassion is required of every Muslim, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves; and</center>

<center>**Whereas**, compassion reminds us to work hard to help one another, our neighbors, and all of Allah’s creatures, treating everybody, **without exception**, with fairness, kindness, and respect; and</center>

<center>**Whereas**, it is also necessary that during and after school hours we persist **to prevent ourselves** from:</center>

<center>- **Hurting Anyone's Feelings**  
- **Taking Credit for Someone Else's Work**  
- **Acting or Speaking Sarcastically Towards Anyone**  
- **Participating in or Allowing Any Form of Bullying**</center>

<center>**Therefore**, Pillars Academy Student Council proclaims and calls upon all students to lead by example in being compassionate as was taught to us by our Prophet (PBUH). In doing so, we will be positive role models to one another, our diverse community, and international pen pals.</center>
