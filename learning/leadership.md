# Leadership Program

Students are encouraged to lead by example and to continuously strive to improve themselves, their families, their communities, and their environment. To that end, our school wide "six week" themes include Islamic leadership traits which are developed throughout the day by secular as well as Islamic subject teachers. The Islamic leadership traits, such as commitment, responsibility, honesty, respect, are embedded in all student activities and within the positive discipline and Caught Ya! incentive system. Every Pillars Academy student has potential to lead and all students are given opportunities to maximize this potential. Students take on leadership roles within groups in their classrooms and as representatives of their class for school wide function in service learning initiatives.

Whether a pre-schooler or an upper elementary student, at Pillars Academy every child is encouraged to set career goals through exposure to highly accomplished Muslim American men and women. Motivational speakers are regularly invited to speak to students about embodying leadership qualities and ways of being of service to others.

Third through sixth grade students compose our student body government, as well as lead prayers and assemblies for the school. As students reach a level of capability, they are selected to prepare and deliver a Friday Prayer Khutba to peers on student relevant topics encompassing the current theme's Islamic leadership traits and values providing references from the Prophets (SAWS).

Caring for and appreciating our precious Earth and its inhabitants is an essential responsibility of all Muslims. Students practice social and environmental consciousness through service learning initiatives, such as feeding the homeless, organizing and/or participating in walkathons, leading fundraisers for charity, and recycling. Upper grade students are in charge of the school-wide recycling program as well as engaging in community civic functions.
