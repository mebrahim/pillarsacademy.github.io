# Religious Studies

The goal of our religious studies program is for each and every child to develop a positive image of him/herself as a Muslim. The curriculum is divided into three areas, each taught by a teacher who specializes in the subject matter.

#### Quran

Pillars Academy students are taught that the Quran is a source of divine knowledge that must be read, understood, committed to memory, and most importantly, applied to daily life. Students attend Quran class on a daily basis with the goal of memorizing Juz' Amma (the 30th part of the Quran) by the completion of 6th grade. Students are also taught to read the Quran with proper pronunciation and are expected to be high-intermediate level readers by 6th grade.

#### Islamic Studies

The goal of our Islamic studies curriculum is to teach students to embody Islam in all aspects of their lives. To that end, students attend classes where they learn about Islamic mannerisms and values, the pillars of Islam, stories of the prophets, how to perform ablutions and daily prayers, daily duas to be recited, the seerah, and the Islamic calendar, among other topics. Upper gradersâ€™ learning delves into deeper subjects such as tawheed, the ninety-nine names of Allah, important dates in Islamic history, and the more detailed rites of the religion. All grade levels are taught the meanings of key surahs which are translated and discussed in class.

#### Arabic Language

Pillars Academy's Arabic language curriculum was developed to enhance students' understanding of the language of the Quran. Aligning to the school wide global perspective themes, Arabic lessons are designed to engage students in making connections across their core secular subjects, Arabic language, Quran and Islamic Studies. Students attend Arabic class on a daily basis where they are taught to read, write and converse in Arabic.

By the time our students reach 6th grade they can read and write in Arabic as well as carry on conversations about themselves, community, identity and family, health, Islamic events and holidays, hobbies and entertainment, and daily activities.
