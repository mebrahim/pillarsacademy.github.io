The Parent Teacher Council (PTC) is a volunteer arm of Pillars Academy established to support the school’s goals and create an environment that will be nurturing and uplifting for all.
Purpose

####The purpose of the Pillars Academy PTC is to:

####What is PTC?

Our Parent-Teacher Council consists of individuals working together to support and enrich Pillars Academy. The PTC supports school staff, promotes student self-esteem, and solves school needs through volunteering and funding.

Room parents working together with our staff, conduct monthly meetings to plan valuable family activities and fundraising events. Check out the list of events in the school’s annual calendar. There is always a project underway for you to help with!

Smaller scale PTC activities happen daily at Pillars Academy. Whether it’s volunteering in a classroom or preparing treats for staff appreciation week, we encourage all Pillars Academy parents to participate whenever possible. Attending monthly PTC meetings isn’t a prerequisite!

The heart of the PTC really is this everyday working relationship between parents and staff. The effort put forth on a daily basis at Pillars Academy is extraordinary. On behalf of Pillars Academy, we would like to thank each parent, staff member and volunteer who works so hard all year long to make our school an educationally enriched environment for our kids.

Thank you for your commitment to our students.

Sign up today to be a PTC member. Together we can make a difference!

####PTC President Report 2012/2013  
Pillars Academy PTC had a successful 2012/2013 school year ---all praise and thanks to Allah (SWT) and of course with great appreciation for the support of our wonderful Pillars Academy parents.

The PTC was able to support the school and help make the Scholastic Book Fair successful. The PTC utilized money raised from both the Cookie Dough Fundraiser and the bake sales throughout the year to help the school through by offering monthly parenting classes and contributing to curriculum resource expenses as well as replenish PE equipment. At the end of the year, the PTC had a balance of $1900 to be transferred to the next PTC for the 2013/2014 school year.

As for initiatives, the PTC organized two Movie Nights and a Family Potluck Night which was a joint effort with OCIF. The events helped create a sense of community among parents and the school. Other activities held by the PTC included the monthly parent and student lunch and the end of year Bubble Show. Additionally, the PTC also organized Teacher Appreciation Week.

The PTC helped recruit and form a Year Book Committee which successfully published a Pillars Academy yearbook for the 2012/2013 school year. Further, the PTC contributed to the school monthly newsletter and maintained a PTC corner. The Corner kept parents updated about activities and events which was beneficial for parents who were not able to attend the monthly PTC meetings.

Finally, the PTC strived to be a strong liaison between Pillars Academy parents and the administration by keeping an open line of communication and helping to channel all efforts towards the growth of Pillars Academy.

On behalf of all officers and parents, I wish the best of luck and continued success to all our new PTC officers and members, for the year 2013-2104!

PTC President
2012/2013
